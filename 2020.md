# 2020

## January - April

These 4 months consisted mainly of coursework as I was finishing up my undergraduate degree at UWaterloo.
I'll give a summary of the more interesting courses I took:

- CS487 (Introduction to Symbolic Computation):
This course was the perfect balance between mathematics and computer science.
_Some_ of the proofs were glossed over (which was actually reasonable since an algebra course was not a prereq), but the textbook: _[Modern Computer Algebra, 3rd Edition (von Zer Gathen, Gerhard)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/modern-computer-algebra/DB3563D4013401734851CF683D2F03F0#)_ went through all the gory details so I was content.
We pretty much went through all of Part I and II and Chapter 14, of which I typed up partial [notes](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/cs487/cs487.pdf) for.

- CO749 (Random Graph Theory):
We surveyed most of the major results and built up probability tools along the way as needed.
The probability was manageable, but I definitely didn't expect us to use differential equations as a tool in the last 2 weeks of the course.
I typed up partial [lecture summaries](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/co749_random/co749.pdf), but omitted most the of calculations cause they were quite gruesome.
The main reference was [Bollobás' book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/random-graphs/E21023008001CFA182CE666F5028489F), but it was actually a bit too fast for me to follow so I also referenced [Frieze and Karoński's book](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/discrete-mathematics-information-theory-and-coding/introduction-random-graphs?format=HB).

In addition, for CS487, I wrote up a project surveying primality testing methods which I may put up on a later date.
Quite a fun project--pretty much covered all of chapter 18 in the textbook, but also had to hunt around for references to other algorithms.
