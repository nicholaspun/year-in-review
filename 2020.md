## Coursework

I spent January to April finishing up my undergraduate degree in CS and Combinatorics and Optimization at UWaterloo.
As a result of only having 2 easy required courses left to take, I spent most of term absorbing as much combinatorics knowledge as I could:

- Random Graph Theory (CO 749): 
We worked through some major results and built up probability tools along the way as needed.
The key highlight for me was probably a more thorough understanding of various concentration results.
I gave up on LaTeXing my notes since the calculations were quite gruesome, but have some hybrid [typed/scanned notes](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/co749_random/co749.pdf) on my notes site.
The main reference was [Bollobás' book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/random-graphs/E21023008001CFA182CE666F5028489F), but it was actually a bit too fast for me to follow so I also referenced [Frieze and Karoński's book](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/discrete-mathematics-information-theory-and-coding/introduction-random-graphs?format=HB).

- Graph Colourings (CO 749):
We went through a lot of the cutting edge (as of the time this was written) in graph colourings.
To be very honest, a _lot_ of the content went over my head.
At the very least, though, I walked away with a _much_ more expanded view of graph theory and, as a bonus, picked up a couple tools, methods and concepts along the way.
Overall, everything covered in this course was _super_ interesting and I definitely gained a better appreciation of some of the deeper results.
Some of the references we went through can be found in my [scans](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/co749_colourings/co749.pdf).

- Combinatorial Design (CO 434):
And now back to courses I actually understood a lot of.
This course was the wildest mishmash of linear algebra, abstract algebra, number theory and combinatorics I've ever seen.
It was so nice to see how seemingly different combinatorial problems could just be cast as one another.
I don't doubt that there were even deeper connections that I missed, so I'll definitely be revisiting this material in the near future.
I started typing up my [notes](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/co434/co434.pdf) and the main reference for this course was Stinson's _[Combinatorial Designs: Constructions and Analysis](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387954875)_.

And since I'm also a CS student, I did actually take some CS courses:

- Introduction to Symbolic Computation (CS 487):
This course was the perfect balance between mathematics and computer science.
_Some_ of the proofs were glossed over (which was actually reasonable since an algebra course was not a prereq), but the textbook: _[Modern Computer Algebra, 3rd Edition (von Zer Gathen, Gerhard)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/modern-computer-algebra/DB3563D4013401734851CF683D2F03F0#)_ went through all the gory details so I was content.
We pretty much went through all of Part I and II and Chapter 14, of which I typed up partial [notes](https://nicholaspun.github.io/course-notes/cs487/cs487.pdf) for. 
I wrote up a project surveying primality testing methods which I may put up on a later date.
Quite a fun project---pretty much covered all of chapter 18 in the textbook, but also had to hunt around for references to other algorithms.

- Models of Computation (CS 365):
Took a deep dive into most of Part I (Automata theory) and Part II (Computability theory) of Sipser's _[Introduction to the Theory of Computation, 3rd edition](https://math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html)_.
We meant to do more, that is, the plan was to spend 3-4 weeks on Part III (Complexity theory), but unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we only got through Chapter 7 (Time complexity).
The complexity portion was a bit more interesting to me so my plan is to go through Chapter 8 and 9 by myself and then pick up Arora and Barak's [Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/) and work through that.
